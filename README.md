## Music Recommender System using Apache Spark and Python

Created a recommender system that recommends new musical artists to a user based on their listening history. Suggesting different songs or musical artists to a user is important to many music streaming services, such as Pandora and Spotify. In addition, this type of recommender system could also be used as a means of suggesting TV shows or movies to a user (e.g., Netflix).

To create this system Spark and collaborative filtering technique are used.
